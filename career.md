I have spent the past eleven years working in the field of education, first as a middle-school teacher, then as a K-12 instructional technology specialist, and now as an instructional designer in higher education. A common thread through my approach to each of these roles has been a desire to systematically approach problem-solving as a process of inquiry driven by evidence and data. This approach to my work aligns well with the scholarship required in the Ph.D. program, and I believe it also aligns with the skill set of research faculty. For that reason, I would like to continue to operate in the mindset that I am preparing for a faculty position, even though I have roots in Georgia and will likely not be able to leave the state to pursue faculty positions elsewhere. Should a position become available at an institution in Georgia where I could relocate, then I would strongly consider such a position.

Given the constraints on my mobility and my background working in central support with administrative personnel in both K-12 and higher education, I am also interested in leadership roles within educational institutions. I believe that I could lead such organizations down positive productive path with teaching and learning as the chief consideration for making decisions that affect teachers and students in profound ways.
