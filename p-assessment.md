My first year in the Learning, Design, and Technology program has been both challenging and rewarding. The faculty I have worked with have all been caring, patient, and encouraging, which helps as I move forward with my research plans.

## Coursework

The first year of coursework has helped me build onto my foundation of educational psychology and instructional technology. EDIT9990 Foundations provided a wonderful opportunity to connect or reconnect with the foundation of knowledge in the field of teaching and learning. For me, it was an affirming experience. In 8190 Studio, I have been forced to push myself to learn new skills. My ability to use technology as a tool to design, development, and research has grown further than I could have imagined in the past year.
