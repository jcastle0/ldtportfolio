## Research

The broad classification of learner to learner interaction has been part of the base of education research for many years. Some examples of theory connected to this idea include Vygotsky's social constructivism (1978) and Wenger's communities of practice (1999). More recently, research has focused on these theory are put into practice using internet technology (Gunawardena et. al., 2009; Abdelmalak, 2015). In the context of online learning, these interactions often come in the form of asynchronous online discussions (Fear & Erickson-Brown, 2014). At the heart of this line of research, I want to investigate what instructors and instructional designers can do to promote meaningful, positive conversations among students. This includes many facets of asynchronous discussions, including how discussion prompts affect the quality of the discussion, what the role of the instructor should be in mediating the discussion, how changing various aspects of asynchronous discussions might change relevant factors such as learner motivation, and what participants percieve as high quality interactions in asynchronous online discussions.

I am also considering how communication theory can inform my research. In thinking about the student to students interactions that happen during an asynchronous discussion, it is useful to consider what is meant as an “interaction.” The interactive model of communication assumes a reciprocal relationship rather than the simple sending and recieving of messages (Richey, Klein & Tracey, 2010). Conversely, communication is a means of sharing information, interpreting information that has been shared, and responding to messages. The interpretive portion of this process involves individuals making meaning in light of their own background and prior experience. It is through this process of of meaning making and responding that the interactive process aims to build common understanding regarding a topic or question.

The transactional perspective of communication builds upon the interactive perspective, characterizing communication as a process by which learners cooperate in order to construct both individualized and contextual knowledge (Richey, Klein, & Tracey, 2010). Campos (2007) describes communication as the process of making sense of both self and the outside world, drawing on the theories of Jean Piaget, Jean-Blaize Grize, and Jürgen Habermas. The construction of knowledge from this perspective shaped by the background and experiences of the participants as they intersect with social and political elements of the context where the communication takes place.

### Current Research Questions

1. What constitutes an educative contribution to an asynchronous online discussion?
2. What design practices have the most profound impact on asynchronous online discussions?
3. What is the impact of the design of the discussion prompt on the quality of an asynchronous online discussion?
4. What teaching practices have the most profound impact on asynchronous online discussions?

It is my goal to inform the design and practice of asynchronous online discussions in order to increase the likelihood that students will create contributions and interactions that contribute positively to the overall learning experience of the class.
