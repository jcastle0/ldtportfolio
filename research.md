## Research

I am interested in the broad idea of knowledge creation through learner to learner interaction. In the context of online learning, these interactions often come in the form of asynchronous online discussions (Fear & Erickson-Brown, 2014). At the heart of this line of research, I want to investigate what instructors and instructional designers can do to promote meaningful, positive conversations among students.

### Current Research Questions

1. What constitutes an educative contribution to an asynchronous online discussion?
2. What design practices have the most profound impact on asynchronous online discussions?
3. What is the impact of the design of the discussion prompt on the quality of an asynchronous online discussion?
4. What teaching practices have the most profound impact on asynchronous online discussions?

It is my goal to inform the design of asynchronous online discussions in order to increase the likelihood that students will create contributions and interactions that contribute positively to the overall learning experience of the class.
