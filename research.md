## Research

The broad classification of learner to learner interaction has been part of the base of education research for many years. Some examples of theory connected to this idea include Vygotsky's social constructivism (1978) and Wenger's communities of practice (1999). More recently, research has focused on these theory are put into practice using internet technology (Gunawardena et. al., 2009; Abdelmalak, 2015). In the context of online learning, these interactions often come in the form of asynchronous online discussions (Fear & Erickson-Brown, 2014). At the heart of this line of research, I want to investigate what instructors and instructional designers can do to promote meaningful, positive conversations among students. This includes many facets of asynchronous discussions, including how discussion prompts affect the quality of the discussion, what the role of the instructor should be in mediating the discussion, how changing various aspects of asynchronous discussions might change relevant factors such as learner motivation, and what participants percieve as high quality interactions in asynchronous online discussions.

### Current Research Questions

1. What constitutes an educative contribution to an asynchronous online discussion?
2. What design practices have the most profound impact on asynchronous online discussions?
3. What is the impact of the design of the discussion prompt on the quality of an asynchronous online discussion?
4. What teaching practices have the most profound impact on asynchronous online discussions?

It is my goal to inform the design of asynchronous online discussions in order to increase the likelihood that students will create contributions and interactions that contribute positively to the overall learning experience of the class.
