  <p>Hello! I am James Castle, and I am a doctoral student in the Learning, Design, and Technology program at the University of Georgia. I am also an instructional designer in the Office of Online Learning at the University of Georgia. My wife and I have a six-year-old daughter, and we line with our three dogs. I make it a point to get to the gym at least 4 days a week, and I've been an avid PC gamer since the mid 1980s.</p>
